*“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control...”  
(Galatians 5:22-23)*  
  
We are called by Christ to be an example in this world. To be filled with the Holy Spirit, and to carry the fruits of the Spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  
  
Yet we fail to see these fruits in your words and actions.  
  
Where is the **love** towards the liberals, democrats, and well anyone who is against your party or religion?  
  
Where is the **joy** in locking innocent children in detention centers?  
  
Where is the **peace** in dividing your country?  
  
Where is the **patience** in assassinating a foreign general?  
  
Where is the **kindness** in cyberbullying a 16-year-old girl?  
  
Where is the **goodness** in blocking gun-control, despite gun violence being out of control?  
  
Where is **faithfulness** in the Word of God? Where is your love towards all your neighbors? Towards fellow citizens in Puerto Rico? Where?  
  
Where is the **gentleness** in dismantling welfare?  
  
Where is the **self-control** in any of your actions in the Senate? God calls us to follow his law, which is to love Him, love ourselves, and love all others. Yet it seems as if something else is controlling your actions, because there’s a distinct lack of love.  
  
**Being a Christian isn’t simply saying that you believe in God.**  
  
**Being a Christian is taking action in concordance with the Word of God.**  
  
Christians are **loving** towards all people no matter race, color, political affiliation, religion, citizenship status, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or disability.  
  
Christians do all they can to spread **joy** and **peace** wherever they can. No matter the (political) costs.  
  
Christians have **patience** and do not take matters in their own hands. Jehovah Jireh.  
  
Christians are **kind** towards others, and stand up for those without a voice.  
  
Christians are **good** to others, they do all they can to lessen the suffering of others, even if it may cost you a lot. The Lord will Provide.  
  
Christians are **faithful**. They trust in God, and not in things of this world. They read His Word and know His ways.  
  
Christians are gentle. **Gentleness** puts others first. Gentleness doesn’t hate or throw insults. Gentleness recognizes that not everyone is as blessed as we are, and is deserving of grace (a free and unmerited favor). And for that reason gentleness extends the grace of God.  
  
Christians have **self-control**. The self-control to keep looking towards God. The self-control to choose to go against your party despite the intense pressure to vote in lockstep. The self-control to read the following TRUTH and not downplay it with lies. With your own thinking, and own beliefs.  
  
*But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any **so-called brother** if he is an **immoral person**, or **covetous**, or an **idolater**, or a **reviler**, or a drunkard, or a **swindler**--not even to eat with such a one.   
(1 Corinthians 5:11)*

“Whoever says to the **guilty**, "You are innocent," will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations”  
(Proverbs 24:24)

You can choose to hide the truth from your people, but I hope you realize you can't hide it from the One you claim to serve.

You have been blinded by power, money and greed.  
Your god is power, money and greed.  
Your god has made you blind to countless atrocities.  
  
A government is supposed to take care of its citizens.  
Yet this administration has abused its citizens.  
  
If you support this administration:  
  
You are abusing your nation for your own gain.  
You are dividing your country.  
You are dividing the Church of Christ.  
  
It’s not too late to repent.  
It’s not too late to change course.  
It’s not too late until it’s too late.  
  
And once it's too late, you can be sure that justice will come.  
  
Justice for abusing your nation for your own gain.  
Justice for dividing your country.  
And Divine Justice for dividing the Church of Christ.  
  
I pray that you all truly belong to God  
  
*“Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. **The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.**”  
(John 8:47)*
